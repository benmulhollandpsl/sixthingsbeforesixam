            I have been so nervous about starting to work on this project, I forgot that I have over 29 years of experience with this. 
            I've decided to lean on my performance experience and start with teh smallest possible unit of work, adn for today aug 18 I hit record and noticed i was able to get familiar in 5 minutes with the layouts, and now i can watch the video to get more familiar with out clickign and exerting anxiety, and i can think about hte next steps involved.
            this literally was a silly as logging into godaddy, wordpress, and clicking to follow links but my hangup was existential and not skills based.  This was the first big step into the unknown after all the coursework and studying and networking. I'm looking forward to sharing non-sensitive screenshots of this process when it gets closer to done.  I also haven't been able to give an estimate, but today I think I finally can at 2.5-3 weeks.  it give me a goal, and i can meet goals so this should be great.

        <p> 8/20 I'm now comfortable with navigating wordpress alittle bit more and amd diving into Wordpress 101, i meet with the client in 2 minutes, and I'm looking forward to getting more done by tomorrow on this website.</p>
